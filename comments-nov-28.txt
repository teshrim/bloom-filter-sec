Security for ADS to-dos (12/28):

-- The abstract and intro need a solid once-over for grammar, punctuation, sentence structure, etc.
-- [DONE] Add a new \heading to set off the paragraphs about our case studies/contributions.  This will help to elevate it's visual importance to (at least) that of the comparison to NY15. 
-- Do we ever actually use Definition 2 (Error probability and error rate)?
-- Text in Section 3 has a lot of parenthetical statements. This seems particularly jarring in "The effect of r" subsection.  Actually beyond that, too.
-- Move Figure 3 to the top of a page.
-- Theorem 3 needs a name.
-- Better explain what the results of Theorems 10, and 11 say together.  (Also, Theorem 9 feels like it is "dangling".)
-- Theorem 10, just say leak is leak_abl
-- Theorem 12, and "in the ROM" to the theorem name

Missing results:

-- Proof of Theorem 4  (OW of classical BF in the ROM)
-- Proof of Theorem 7 (Correctness of linear-PRF)
-- A result on the OW-security of bigram linear-PRF?  This is silently swept under the rug: we give an SS attack, but say nothing about the OW security.  NSKS14 give some sort of OW attack.
-- Correctness bound for private-M GBF in the ROM (HARD!)



Ideas for private-M GBF correctness bound:

I had some solid ideas for how to do this, but I'll have to go looking for where I wrote them down!  I recall it being something along these lines.  Each query allows you to write down at most one GF(2) linear equation.  Write this as a matrix-multiplication problem.  So long as the 0-1 coefficient matrix remains full rank, things remain secure.  Once that stops being true, then (potentially) something bad happens.
