Security for ADS to-dos (12/28):

-- The abstract and intro need a solid once-over for grammar, punctuation, sentence structure, etc.
-- [DONE] Add a new \heading to set off the paragraphs about our case studies/contributions.  This will help to elevate it's visual importance to (at least) that of the comparison to NY15. 
-- Do we ever actually use Definition 2 (Error probability and error rate)?
-- Text in Section 3 has a lot of parenthetical statements. This seems particularly jarring in "The effect of r" subsection.  Actually beyond that, too.
-- Move Figure 3 to the top of a page.
-- Theorem 3 needs a name.
-- Better explain what the results of Theorems 10, and 11 say together.  (Also, Theorem 9 feels like it is "dangling".)
-- Theorem 10, just say leak is leak_abl
-- Theorem 12, and "in the ROM" to the theorem name

Missing results:

-- Proof of Theorem 4  (OW of classical BF in the ROM)
-- Proof of Theorem 7 (Correctness of linear-PRF)
-- A result on the OW-security of bigram linear-PRF?  This is silently swept under the rug: we give an SS attack, but say nothing about the OW security.  NSKS14 give some sort of OW attack.
-- Correctness bound for private-M GBF in the ROM (HARD!)



Ideas for private-M GBF correctness bound (in the ROM):

1) RO queries reveal indices, but not values held in M
2) Upon a *positive* Test query x:
    Let Index(x) = {H_j(x) : j \in {1..k}}.  Let 1[s]=1 iff statement s is true, 0 otherwise.
    
    Adversary learns that  x = \Oplus_{i=1}^{m} 1[i \in Index(x)] M[i], i.e. one equation in m unknown values.

    Say the adversary has make t positive test queries x_1, ... x_t.
    Write the corresponding equations as CM=X where
    C is an m-by-t coefficient matrix of 0/1 values,
    M is the m-by-1 vector of (unknown, uniform) values, and
    X is the t-by-1 vector (x_1,x_2,...,x_t).
    Notice that C and X are known, since C is revealed by RO queries.

    Does knowing C,X help to "extend" X (and C) by one?  This is what's needed to go from t positive Test queries to t+1.
    Does knowing C,X leak information about the values in M?

    Note: that each row of C is 0-1, but (1) at most k of the positions in any row are 1, and (2) those positions are random.
    Note: if you lift the "at most k" restriction and just let each row of C be a uniform element of {0,1}^m, then if row 1,2,...,t are linearly independent, |Span(rows 1,2,...t)|=2^t, so adding the (t+1)-th row is in the span with probability 2^t/2^m.  (This is a conditional probability, of course, conditioned o the first t rows being linearly independent.)

Note: that you can easily bound the number of 1s in any column of C, too, if that helps.  (This is the probability of throwing multiple random balls into one bin.)  It's likely that each column has at most one 1 in it until t = \Theta(sqrt(m)).
